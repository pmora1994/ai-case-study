## Overview and Origin

* [Algo Exchange Trading](https://www.algoexchange.com/) was founded in 2023 by Austin Alhajj in Florida who had the idea of developing an algorithmic and automated trading platform for retail and institutional traders. As do all startups, this company took a lot of time for Austin to develop over the years leading up to launch. Funding was found through his own capital as an experienced retail trader and from his business venture of successfully building a working space for traders called The Trade Club. With the original intent of creating a automated platform, Austin and his team have developed multiple algorithims from his past trading data and personal experience to adapt to the traders current plan to minimize trading emotions.


## Business Activities

* Although automated trading has been around for years, Algo Exchange stands out by being more accessible to the more casual retail trader. However, they will need a $25k account minimum in order to access this license. Now this may be a steep entry but this proves to the company that the trader is more serious about this line of business since the entry barrier to even start trading is so low to begin with. This restriction will also help override the day trading rule placed by FINRA which limits accounts if they don't have the said account amount.
  
* Even the global financial service company, MorningStar, states that "One of the distinguishing features of Algo Exchange is its focus on major equity indices, deliberately steering clear of the complexities associated with FOREX or Crypto trading" (Accesswire). This proves that AET is spending it's time and resources over very specific results in mind considering different markets that could have different strategies. With that it provides an insight on how the algorithims have been perfected in their own way to maximize results in one particular area rather than across others like FOREX and Crypto which can take more time and error especially at the cost of the user. The company is quite literally handing the torch to all its licensed traders whom have joined and while the system comes with default settings for the newcomer there is complete personalization and customization to allow more epxerienced traders to navigate the program through desired risk to reward ratio strategies in which they prefer.


## Landscape

* Coming from the finance technology field, Algo Exchange trade is defintely not on it's own. Massive hedgefunds like Bridewater Associates and Simplex Asset Management stand as the leading figures in automated trading the last decade. However, where AET stands apart is solely on the main fact on how they're "leading the charge in democratizing access to sophisticated trading and investing tools, opening doors that were once only accessible to the financial elite" (Acesswire). With this newfound ability for trading it could revolutionize the way traders plan their businesses and incentivize learning more about their own stratigies and how they can personalize the algorithims to evolve the way the intend to work for them.

## Results

> "Our custom trading algorithms harness years of comprehensive data to execute precise trades, effectively sidestepping the pitfalls of human error and emotional bias. This allows our users to benefit from a system where skill and effort are not prerequisites for success." - ***Algo Exchange Trading***

* Everything is tracked via a precise profit and loss tracker where the program is linked to the individuals broker and data is collected through each trade to provide real time feedback and information that can be added to the algorithims to develop a more precise setting for the user. Whereas other companies have to track over various platforms and collect data from seperate market sectors, AET can focus on one thing and one thing only from it's more tunnel vision approach: to help the user make more money in the US market space.

## Recommendations

* Algo Exchange Trading is a fascinating company capable of speaheading it's main demographic with the ability to see lifechnaging results. However, I feel that the company should go a step further with how they focus on just larger accounts but instead have access to smaller accounts as well. Risk management and understanding ones psychology and emotions is very important going into this business but to have access and knowledge of how they to develop one's plan while having the assistance of algorithmic trading. Not saying just anyone can participate but a deeper psych evalualtion with a $10k account can have a instant benefit for those who take this business more seriously and allowing AET to tap into a income stream that is much more common.
